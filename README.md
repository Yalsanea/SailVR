# SailVR
Scripts and assets for a VR Game that I am working on in the Unity Engine.

SailVR is an adventure game that focuses mainly on open sea exploration.

In order to use any of these scripts it is assumed that the SteamVR plugin is installed in Unity. The controller bindings will be uploaded at a later date.
Until then, it is possible for you to use your own personal bindings.
